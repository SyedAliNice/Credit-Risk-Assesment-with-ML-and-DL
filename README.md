# Credit Risk Assessment
#   Project Overview

This project focuses on credit risk assessment using machine learning and deep learning models. It utilizes various preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict creditworthiness based on input financial data

# Files and Directories
1.  ann_model.h5: Pre-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN)    model for credit risk assessment.
2. archive.zip: Contains additional datasets or supplementary materials
3.  Credit risk assesment.csv: Dataset used for training and evaluation
4. label_encoder.pkl: Pre-trained label encoder for categorical feature transformation
5.  random_forest_model.pkl: Pre-trained Random Forest model for credit risk prediction.
6.  Standard_scaler.pkl: Pre-trained standard scaler for feature normalization.
7.  Untitled.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

# Installation
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies using:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3.  Ensure all required model files (.h5, .pkl) are placed in 
    the appropriate directories.
 #  Usage
